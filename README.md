# Burger
### Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page. Each burger in the waiting area is also attached a Devour it! button. When the user clicks "Devour It", the burger will move to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.

### How Burger Works
Eat-Da-Burger uses the following node package managers to process requests:
* Express
  - This is the Node.JS web application framework we use for routing
* Express-Handlebars
  - This package handles our html templates that are rendered to the client
* MySQL
  - The MySQL node.js driver allows us to easily interact with our app's database.
